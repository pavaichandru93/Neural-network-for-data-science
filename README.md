The main content of the paper refers to the activation functions that allow us to rapidly train deep neural networks, to the different existing activation functions and their characteristics; also the authors propose a more powerful adaptive activation function. 
For my work, implemented the same activation function to improve the deep neural network using higgs boson experiment as described in the paper, and compared the results with traditional activation functions such as the sigmoid function.
